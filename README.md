# Dispersion engineering of atom-nanophotonic crystal waveguide interfaces

This repository serves as a compilation of the code associated to BeÃ±at Martinez de Aguirre's MSc. Thesis in Computational Physics at the Niels Bohr Institute (NBI). Using analytical methods, Meep and Lumerical we study and optimize the dispersion properties of photonic crystals as well as the emission properties of atoms close to these structures. This will serve for an experimental implementation of a quantum simulator using atom-atom interactions mediated by light.

## Structure of the repository

In this repository one can find the necessary files to reproduce all of the results in the thesis. The structure of the repository works its way up in levels of software difficulty and has the following entries:

- **Example** (Folder 0): Brief overview of how to calculate the main Figures of Merit (FOMs) in the case of the hexagonal holed hexagonal lattice photonic crystal slab, with an explanation on how to run a Lumerical FDTD simulation through its Python API. This example goes is the FDTD example (Appendix C) mentioned in the thesis.

- **Analytical results** (Folder 1): Calculations for the TMM formalism (Chapters 2 & 3) and dipole interactions (Chapter 3).

- **Dispersion and emission properties of photonic crystals** (Folders 2-5): Includes all the relevant calculations for the photonic crystals from the cited literature (Chapter 4), including the double nanobeam and the photonic crystal slabs. It makes use of MIT Photonic Bands (MPB) to calculate band-diagrams and mode profiles and uses Lumerical and Meep for calculating the emission properties from FDTD calculations.

- **New designs for enhanced FOMs** (Folder 6): Novel calculations for the designs leading to improved FOMs. This includes the calculations for the different atoms and those related to the improved design for Caesium (Cs). 

Note that all references are available in the original thesis cited above.
